### Example 1:
User Prompt: find Grade, CourseName where grade > 90 and courseName like '%Math%'

DataBase Schema:
"tables": {
    "courses": ["CourseID","CourseName","InstructorID","InstructorName","CreditHours"],
    "enrollments": ["EnrollmentID","StudentID","CourseID","Semester","Grade"],
    "students": ["StudentID","FirstName","LastName","Email","Major","AdvisorID","AdvisorName"]
}

MySql Query:
{
"sql": "SELECT credithours, MAX(credithours) AS max_value
    FROM courses
    GROUP BY credithours
    ORDER BY max_value DESC
    LIMIT 1;",
}

### Example 2:
User Prompt: list Grade, CourseName in context where grade between 50 and 90

DataBase Schema:
"tables": {
    "courses": ["CourseID","CourseName","InstructorID","InstructorName","CreditHours"],
    "enrollments": ["EnrollmentID","StudentID","CourseID","Semester","Grade"],
    "students": ["StudentID","FirstName","LastName","Email","Major","AdvisorID","AdvisorName"]
}

MySql Query:
{
"sql": "SELECT enrollments.Grade, courses.CourseName
    FROM courses
    JOIN enrollments ON courses.CourseID = enrollments.CourseID
    WHERE grade BETWEEN 50 AND 90;",
}


### Example 3:
User Prompt: get Grade, Major where Grade is not null

DataBase Schema:
"tables": {
    "courses": ["CourseID","CourseName","InstructorID","InstructorName","CreditHours"],
    "enrollments": ["EnrollmentID","StudentID","CourseID","Semester","Grade"],
    "students": ["StudentID","FirstName","LastName","Email","Major","AdvisorID","AdvisorName"]
}

MySql Query:
{
"sql": "SELECT enrollments.Grade, courses.CourseName
    FROM courses
    JOIN enrollments ON courses.CourseID = enrollments.CourseID
    WHERE grade BETWEEN 50 AND 90;",
}

### Example 4:
User Prompt: list unique major in students

DataBase Schema:
"tables": {
    "courses": ["CourseID","CourseName","InstructorID","InstructorName","CreditHours"],
    "enrollments": ["EnrollmentID","StudentID","CourseID","Semester","Grade"],
    "students": ["StudentID","FirstName","LastName","Email","Major","AdvisorID","AdvisorName"]
}
